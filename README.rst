Enable Docker container to use Cinder volume and Manila share

Fuxi focuses on enabling Docker container to use Cinder volume and Manila
share, thus Docker volume can reuse the advance features and numerous vendor
drivers in Cinder and Manila. With Fuxi, Cinder and Manila can be used as
the unified persistence storage provider for virtual machine, baremetal
and Docker container.
