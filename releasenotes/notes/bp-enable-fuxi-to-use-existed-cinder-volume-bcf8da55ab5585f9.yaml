    Support creating Docker volumes by using existing Cinder volumes.
    To use this feature, users need to pass the ID of an existing Cinder
    volume when he/she creates a volume in Docker. For example,

    $ docker volume create --driver fuxi --name test --opt volume_id=<id>

    If a volume_id is given, Fuxi will look up the Cinder volume by the given
    ID and use it as the created Docker volume (instead of creating a new
    volume in Cinder).
